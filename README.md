# Research in object classification and novelty detection
This is a cutting-edge project in the field of machine learning, developed at the ISTC-CNR research centre. The system is designed to work on a robot and it allows to classify everyday objects which are in the environment using a convolutional neural network. Furthermore, I started a research activity to let the robot autonomously detect when the object is unknown to him, so that he can increase his knowledge capturing photos of it. To do this I developed a novelty detection system based on support vector machines.

Technologies involved:
* Python
* TensorFlow
* Scikit-Learn
* OpenCV
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

We got the real objects and the dataset here: http://www.ycbbenchmarks.com
